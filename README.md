# ReedAcademy ðŸŽ·

A blockchain-based professional woodwind training platform built on Stacks that enables musicians to pursue certifications, complete skill assessments, and earn rewards for their musical development.

## Overview

ReedAcademy creates a decentralized educational ecosystem for reed instrument players (woodwinds like clarinet, saxophone, oboe, bassoon) where scholars can take professional certifications, demonstrate their skills through rigorous assessments, and earn Adagio Tokens (RAT) for their achievements. The platform combines professional certification, skill evaluation, and a reward system to incentivize continuous learning and mastery.

## Scholar Progression System

### Proficiency Levels
Progress through five distinct levels:
1. **Novice**: Just starting the musical journey
2. **Developing**: Building foundational skills
3. **Proficient**: Solid core competencies
4. **Advanced**: High-level technical abilities
5. **Expert**: Masterful command of the instrument

### Skill Mastery Score
Your skill mastery increases based on:
- Practical scores from assessments (score/30 per assessment)
- Cumulative growth over time
- Ranges from 1-5 scale

### Profile Statistics
Each scholar profile tracks:
- Total assessments taken
- Total certifications earned
- Total study time (converted to hours)
- Current skill mastery level
- Enrollment date

## Assessment Scoring System

### Three-Dimensional Evaluation
Each assessment measures:
1. **Practical Score** (1-5): Physical technique and performance
2. **Theoretical Knowledge** (1-5): Understanding of music theory
3. **Application Ability** (1-5): Real-world application of skills

### Pass/Fail Determination
- Average score = (Practical + Theoretical + Application) / 3
- Must meet or exceed the certification's passing score
- Failed attempts still receive 10% token reward (0.29 RAT)

## Certification Program Structure

### Skill Domains
- **technique**: Physical playing skills
- **theory**: Music theory and analysis
- **performance**: Stage presence and delivery
- **pedagogy**: Teaching methodologies
- **composition**: Creating original music

### Difficulty Tiers
- **basic**: Foundational level
- **standard**: Intermediate requirements
- **advanced**: High-level challenges
- **expert**: Master-level demands

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Certification

```clarity
(contract-call? .reed-academy create-certification
  "Reed Mastery"
  "technique"
  "advanced"
  u120
  u4
  u50)
```

### Taking an Assessment

```clarity
(contract-call? .reed-academy take-assessment
  u1
  "embouchure"
  u90
  u5
  u4
  u5
  "Excellent!")
```

### Writing an Evaluation

```clarity
(contract-call? .reed-academy write-evaluation
  u1
  u9
  "Outstanding!"
  "superb")
```

### Endorsing an Evaluation

```clarity
(contract-call? .reed-academy endorse-evaluation
  u1
  'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM)
```

### Claiming Mastery

```clarity
(contract-call? .reed-academy claim-mastery "skill-expert")
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Error | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| u100 | err-owner-only | Operation restricted to contract owner |
| u101 | err-not-found | Resource not found |
| u102 | err-already-exists | Resource already exists |
| u103 | err-unauthorized | Unauthorized action |
| u104 | err-invalid-input | Invalid input parameters |

## Security Considerations

1. **Evaluation Protection**: Users can only evaluate each certification once
2. **Self-Endorsement Prevention**: Cannot endorse your own evaluations
3. **Score Validation**: All scores validated within 1-5 or 1-10 ranges
4. **Mastery Claims**: One-time claims with strict requirements
5. **Token Supply Cap**: Maximum supply enforced at 45,000 RAT
6. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated for proper ranges and lengths

## Token Economics Analysis

**Maximum Token Distribution:**
- Assessments (pass): Unlimited Ã— 2.9 RAT = Primary distribution
- Assessments (fail): Unlimited Ã— 0.29 RAT = Secondary distribution
- Certifications: Unlimited Ã— 7.4 RAT = Instructor rewards
- Masteries: 2 masteries Ã— 16.5 RAT = 33 RAT per scholar max
- **Total Supply Cap**: 45,000 RAT (45,000,000,000 micro-tokens)

The reward structure incentivizes both assessment completion (learning) and certification creation (teaching), while providing consolation rewards for failed attempts to encourage persistence.

## Development
